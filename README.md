# geometrylibrary

Objectives
==========

Pet project to avoid reinventing the wheel on my side and to implement a geometric library nicely designed (closer to the mathematical concepts).

- src: contains source code
- utests: contains tests
- pythonwrappers: contains code for using the c++ lib with python

Installation
============
Requires GTests (and Python ?)

- Clone repository
$ git clone https://github.com/cquennouelle/geometrylibrary.git
- Create build directory and build source code:
$ cd geometrylibrary
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make
- Launch tests
$ utests/Geometry_UT
